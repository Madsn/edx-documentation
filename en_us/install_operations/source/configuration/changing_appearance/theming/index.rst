Changing an Open edX Theme
############################

The theme for a website defines its appearance: the logo, the color scheme, and
the links in the page headers and footers are examples of different aspects of
an Open edX site that are defined by its theme.

All Open edX instances have a default theme that you can replace with your
own versions of page templates, CSS styling, and assets such as the logo and
other images. You can change the appearance of the following parts of your Open
edX installation.

* The Studio user interface (UI), which is used by course teams.

* The learning management system (LMS) UI, which is used by learners and course
  teams.

* The Ecommerce UI, which is used by course offering and order managers.

The topics in this section describe how you can change the way an Open edX
instance looks, without changing how it works.
